    description: "While I wouldn't call myself a political musician, and I have no interest in becoming a politician, I will never limit myself by purposely straying away from political topics or themes in my music. If I'm passionate about something, I'll explore it musically. Therefore, my political convictions will influence my art. I don't expect everyone that stumbles upon my work to have the same opinions as I do, but some songs might be less relatable to people on the opposite end of where I reside on the political spectrum. I'm not yet confident enough that my lyrics will always reflect my beliefs accurately, due to the fact that I like to use irony as a rhetorical device. What is and isn't ironic is mostly up to interpretation, so as to not be misconstrued, I will outline the core of my political beliefs on this page. I encourage you to read more about the discussed topics yourself, since I am not an expert. I don't aim or expect to change your mind, just to give you a peek into mine.<br><br>I am thoroughly and unabashedly what you may call a leftist. When it comes to our current society, I believe in the importance of a stable government. If capitalism is here to stay, then it needs to be regulated heavily. Without enough regulation, the rich will continue to grow richer, while the poor continue to grow poorer. We should strive for more of the means of production to be owned by the people. Since this isn't possible in a capitalist system, a democratically appointed government should own these means of production. For a capitalist society to be 'fair' (which it will never truly be) it requires its citizens to pay taxes. This is to fund the government and its crucial functions (healthcare, education, infrastructure, regulation, etc.), and it is an inescapable consequence of capitalism. While this may seem illogical to you, arguing for less taxes under capitalism is arguing for a more unjust society. I base this position on my fundamental belief, that while every human life is equal, no one is brought into this world under the same conditions. These conditions consist of many parametres that can all be placed under one of two categories: <b>nature</b> or <b>nurture</b>. Some may argue that these are opposites and question, which of these are responsible for someones behavior. But my stance is that they coexist and compliment each other to create a person's conditions in life. <b>Nature</b> is what you are born with, your genetic makeup. This includes any diagnoses you may have througout your life, that are caused by your genetics. <b>Nurture</b> Is everything after your birth. It's the people around you, your family, your friends, your teachers. It's the country, the region, the social class, and the communities you were born into. It's your social, cultural, and economic inheritence. <br><br> No one has chosen their own nature or nurture (I'd even argue that free will doesn't exist). Yet these are aspects of who you are, that heavily influence your life in countless unexpected ways. Your chances of becoming what is considered succesful in today's society hinge on these aspects, which are completely out of your control. Your genetics and cultural inheritance determine your ability to learn, which in turn has bearing on your entire education. The current education system isn't conducive to learning for everyone, and some have it way harder than others. Your economic and social inheritance also affect your options when it comes to schooling in many areas of the world. In those same areas, where you went to school could also determine your job prospects. This wouldn't be as much of a problem, if your job wasn't directly tied to your living conditions. I we truly believe that all human life is equal, which I will admit not everyone does, then the society we have constructed does not reflect that belief. 1 percent of the global population controls around 50 percent of the worlds wealth. It is utterly immoral to condone a system that enables the 1 percent and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie'>bourgeoisie</a> (i.e. the wealthy) to exploit the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat'>proletariat</a> (i.e. the working class) through lifelong health-destroying wage labour under the illusion, that their hard work will one day be fairly rewarded. It is reprehensibly immoral to condone a system that rewards greed and selfish decisions that perpetuate and ignore the very real threat of climate change. It is disgustingly immoral to condone a system that allows for <a href='https://www.actionagainsthunger.org/world-hunger-facts-statistics#:~:text=Around%20the%20world%2C%20more%20than,8.9%20percent%20of%20people%20globally.'>690 million people</a> to starve, while enough food waste is produced by the world to feed <a href='https://www.worldvision.org/hunger-news-stories/food-waste#:~:text=As%20American%20families%20prepare%20to,of%20the%20global%20food%20supply.'>2 billion people</a> every year. As I touched on earlier, a truly fair democracy cannot coexist with capitalism. This is due to political lobbying. While we tell ourselves that our vote means just as much as everyone else's, it really doesn't when corporations can freely and legally donate to politicians, so that they operate with their interests in mind. It also doesn't help that capitalism incentivises politicians to make decisions that prioritize their pursuit of power over the good of the people. True democracy is only one of the illusions of capitalism.<br><br>Idealistically, I support anarcho-communism and would describe myself as an anarcho-communist. An anarcho-communist society would be moneyless, classless, and stateless, and the means of production would be owned by the people, not the rich. Private property would be abolished, but personal property would be respected. I believe in the following principle: " + '<i><b>"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."</b></i> This entails that everyone work the amount they deem appropriate and take what they think they need. '+"While you should but can't expect everyone to work the amount they are actually capable of or not take more than what they actually need, a lot of the motivation will be handled by public pressure. You work, not because you get paid, but because that's what your community expects from you. This type of society isn't built on individual transactions, where we owe each other money for goods, services or labor. We owe the entire community our labor, and get everything we need in return. "+'<br><br>Most rational people would probably agree with the following position: "Everyone should be able to do what they want, as long as it is not harmful." '+"That sounds reasonable, right? Yeah, but it doesn't say much. It all lies in that one word: <b>harmful</b>. What we consider to be harmful varies substantially. Different communities will view harm differently. Some might think that homosexuality (as an example) is harmful, and that they are morally superior. These people are wrong. Some might think that only what directly harms someone should be considered harmful, and that they are pragmatic and sensible. These people are also wrong. What some might call political incorrectness is harmful, albeit indirectly, if it promotes harmful ideas. You might think: What about freedom of speech? And to that I say: Sure. Freedom of speech is important. The government shouldn't censor you. But freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of consequence. You have the right to say whatever you want, but so does everyone else. If you anger people, those people have a right to be angry and vocal in their anger. If a comedian tells a joke at the expense of an opressed group, then that promotes a harmful idea of superiority, no matter the comedian's intention. As soon as art is put out into the world, it no longer fully belongs to the artist. Art is up to interpretation, and you're not exempt from criticism, if the interpretation doesn't match the intention. As someone with a platform, it is your responsibility to ensure, that your message isn't harmful."
